# Continue Issue

Resume work on an in-progress issue by reconstructing session state from the issue checkboxes. Tasks are session-scoped and disappear between conversations — this skill rebuilds them so progress tracking stays accurate.

**IMPORTANT:** Read the entire Pre-flight section before taking any action.

## Pre-flight

<pre_flight>

**Inputs:** `$ARGUMENTS` → issue number (positive integer, accepts `#N` or `N`). If absent, auto-detect from branch name (`feat/<N>-*` or `feature/<N>-*`).

**Reads:** `.docs/issues/<N>.md` (local issue body), `.docs/architecture.md`, `.docs/quality.md`, CLAUDE.md, `.claude/project-setup.json`.

**Checks:**

1. `which gh` → if missing: "GitHub CLI required." — stop.
2. `gh auth status` → if not authenticated: "Run `gh auth login` first." — stop.
3. Current directory is a git repo → if not: "Must run inside a git repo." — stop.
4. **Read `.docs/architecture.md`** → if exists, read and store. Primary codebase context.
5. **Read `.docs/quality.md`** → if exists, read and store. Code quality standards for this project.

</pre_flight>

## Steps

### 1. Identify the issue

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for an issue number. Accept `#N` or `N`.

If no argument provided, detect from the current branch name:

```bash
git branch --show-current | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | head -1
```

Branches follow `feat/<number>-<slug>` or `feature/<number>-<slug>`. Extract the number.

If detection fails, query the project board for issues in "In Progress":

```bash
PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gh project list --owner "@me" --format json | jq -r '.projects[0].number')
gh project item-list "$PROJECT_NUMBER" --owner "@me" --format json | jq '[
  .items[]
  | select(.status == "In Progress")
  | "#\(.content.number) — \(.content.title)"
]'
```

Present the list with `AskUserQuestion` if multiple. If only one, use it automatically.

If no issue found, stop: "No in-progress issue found. Use `/start-issue` to begin one."

### 2. Read the issue and parse progress

Read the local issue body first. If `.docs/issues/<N>.md` exists, use it as the source of truth. Fall back to GitHub API only if the local file is missing:

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json body,title,labels -q '{title: .title, labels: [.labels[].name], body: .body}'
```

Parse the issue body to extract:

1. **Steps** — each `## Step N — Title` section
2. **Checkbox states** — for each step, count checked `- [x]` vs unchecked `- [ ]` checkboxes
3. **Step status** — derive from checkboxes:
   - All checkboxes checked → `completed`
   - At least one checked, others unchecked → `in_progress`
   - No checkboxes checked → `pending`
4. **Next step** — first step that is `pending` or `in_progress`

Present a status table:

```
| Step | Title                  | Progress | Status      |
|------|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| 1    | Scaffold frontend      | 4/4      | completed   |
| 2    | Scaffold backend       | 6/6      | completed   |
| 3    | Test isolation          | 3/6      | in_progress |
| 4    | Configure Playwright   | 0/5      | pending     |
| ...  | ...                    | ...      | ...         |
```

### 2b. Validate the next step

After identifying the next step (first `pending` or `in_progress`), validate its structure before starting work. If `.claude/scripts/validate-issue.sh` exists in the project, run:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/validate-issue.sh <number> --step <next-step-number>
```

- **Errors** → fix the issue body (add missing tags, split oversized steps) and re-validate until it passes. Do NOT start work on a step with validation errors.
- **Warnings** → report to user in the status table, but proceed. Warnings are advisory.
- **Script not found** → skip validation silently (not all projects have the validator).

### 3. Recreate the task board

Create one `TaskCreate` per Step, matching the parsed status:

- **Completed steps** → create task then immediately `TaskUpdate` to `completed`
- **In-progress step** → create task then `TaskUpdate` to `in_progress`
- **Pending steps** → create task (stays `pending`)

Task subjects follow the pattern: `Step N — Title` (matching the issue exactly).

### 4. Load codebase context

Pre-flight already loaded `.docs/architecture.md` and `.docs/quality.md`. Additionally:

- **Read issue comments** for recent context:
  ```bash
  gh issue view <number> --json comments --jq '.comments[-3:] | .[] | {author: .author.login, body: .body}'
  ```
  Last 3 comments may contain scope changes, blocker resolutions, or implementation hints from previous sessions.

- **Check git log** for recent work on this branch:
  ```bash
  git log main..HEAD --oneline --no-decorate | head -10
  ```
  Recent commits reveal what was already implemented.

### 5. Report and begin

Present concisely:
- **Issue** — #N title
- **Progress** — X/Y steps completed
- **Next step** — Step N title with its unchecked checkboxes listed
- **Recent commits** — last 3 commits on branch (if any)
- **Context loaded** — `.docs/architecture.md`, `.docs/quality.md`, last comments

Then **immediately begin working on the next pending step**. Read the step's checkboxes from the issue body and execute them in order. Each checkbox has a tag that determines execution behavior:

| Tag | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `[RED]` | Write the failing test as described in the checkbox |
| `[GREEN]` | Implement code to pass the test |
| `[INFRA]` | Execute infrastructure/config task |
| `[WIRE]` | Connect layers as described |
| `[E2E]` | Write the Playwright E2E test |

Execute tags in order. The RED→GREEN cycle is vertical TDD (one test, one implementation). After completing each checkbox, check it off in `.docs/issues/<N>.md`.

## Error handling

| Failure | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| `gh` auth expired | AUQ: "Run `gh auth login`" → stop |
| Issue not found | Report number and suggest `gh issue list` → stop |
| No in-progress issues | Inform user, suggest `/start-issue` → stop |
| Branch doesn't match issue | Warn user, offer to checkout correct branch via AUQ |
| Issue has no Steps | "This issue wasn't created with `/start-issue`. Use `/start-issue` to restructure it." → stop |
| `.docs/issues/<N>.md` missing | Fall back to GitHub API, warn user |

## Anti-patterns

- **Recreating tasks without reading the issue.** Tasks must match issue checkbox state exactly — because stale tasks mislead about actual progress and cause duplicate work.
- **Modifying the GitHub issue body directly.** Edit `.docs/issues/<N>.md` locally. Only `/push` syncs checkboxes back to GitHub — because concurrent edits cause last-write-wins data loss.
- **Skipping context loading.** Starting work without reading `.docs/architecture.md`, `.docs/quality.md`, and recent comments — because the agent in a new session has zero context and will produce code that doesn't follow project patterns.
- **Re-doing completed work.** Always check git log for recent commits before starting — because the previous session may have committed work that the issue checkboxes don't yet reflect.

## Next action

When all dev steps are complete (all checkboxes checked):

```
-> Next: run `/review` to start the quality review phase
```

When individual steps are complete:

```
-> Next: continue with Step N+1, or run `/push` to commit progress
```
